        🏥 HIPAA HEALTHCARE COMPLIANCE FRAMEWORK:
        
        KEY DEFINITIONS:
        • Protected Health Information (PHI): Any individually identifiable health information
        • Covered Entities: Healthcare providers, health plans, clearinghouses
        • Business Associates: Third parties handling PHI for covered entities
        • Minimum Necessary: Limit PHI to minimum needed for purpose
        
        REQUIRED SAFEGUARDS:
        • Administrative: Policies, workforce training, access management
        • Physical: Facility controls, workstation security, device controls
        • Technical: Access controls, audit logs, encryption, authentication
        
        INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS:
        • Access to own PHI, amendment requests, restriction requests
        • Accounting of disclosures, confidential communications
        • Breach notification within 60 days

        🎯 HEALTHCARE COMPLIANCE ANALYSIS:
        
        You are a HIPAA compliance expert analyzing this healthcare document. 
        Examine how Protected Health Information (PHI) is handled against HIPAA requirements.
        
        🔍 HIPAA VIOLATION ASSESSMENT:
        
        1. PHI AUTHORIZATION: Does the document describe using/disclosing PHI without proper authorization?
           - Look for: "shared without consent", "no authorization required", "automatic sharing"
           
        2. BUSINESS ASSOCIATES: Are third parties accessing PHI without Business Associate Agreements?
           - Look for: "vendors access PHI", "no contracts required", "third parties handle data"
           
        3. INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS: Are patients denied their HIPAA rights?
           - Look for: "cannot access records", "no amendment allowed", "restricted rights"
           
        4. SAFEGUARDS: Are administrative, physical, or technical safeguards inadequate?
           - Look for: "basic security", "no encryption", "minimal protection", "disposed in trash"
           
        5. BREACH NOTIFICATION: Are breach procedures inadequate?
           - Look for: "90 days notification" (should be 60), "no patient notification", "optional reporting"
           
        6. MINIMUM NECESSARY: Is excessive PHI being used/disclosed?
           - Look for: "entire medical record", "all patient data", "unlimited access"
        
        🏥 HEALTHCARE REASONING PROCESS:
        
        For each statement in the document:
        1. Identify if it involves PHI handling
        2. Check against specific HIPAA regulation provided above
        3. Determine if practice violates HIPAA requirements
        4. Consider healthcare context (treatment/payment/operations have different rules)
        5. Flag only clear violations with textual evidence
        
        📋 RESPONSE FORMAT - Return ONLY a JSON array:
        [
        ["Clear HIPAA violation description", "Specific HIPAA section (§164.xxx)", "Exact quote from document"],
        ["Another healthcare violation", "Another HIPAA section", "Another exact quote"]
        ]
        
        🏥 HEALTHCARE EXAMPLES:
        ✅ GOOD: ["PHI shared without authorization", "§164.502", "patient data shared with companies without consent"]
        ✅ GOOD: ["Missing business associate agreement", "§164.314", "vendors access PHI without contracts"]
        ❌ BAD: Flagging compliant statements like "We protect patient privacy" or "HIPAA training provided"
        
        🎯 FINAL INSTRUCTION:
        Base your analysis ONLY on the HIPAA regulations provided above. Focus on PHI protection, not general healthcare practices. If no clear HIPAA violations are found, return: []
