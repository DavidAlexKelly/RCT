# Example Framework Topic Classification
# This file defines what keywords indicate house rule content

framework: example_framework
version: "1.0"

# HOW THIS WORKS:
# The system scans each document section for these keywords.
# If a section contains keywords from 2+ categories (analysis_threshold below),
# then that section gets analysed by the AI. Otherwise it's skipped for efficiency.

# Regulated topics with their associated keywords
# Each category represents a different aspect of house rules
regulated_topics:
  # Cleaning and maintenance activities

# IMPORTANT: This threshold determines how selective the analysis is
# - Higher number (3+) = Only very relevant sections analysed (faster, might miss some)
# - Lower number (1-2) = More sections analysed (slower, more thorough)
# Most frameworks use 2 as a good balance
analysis_threshold: 2

# High priority combinations that definitely need analysis
# If these topic pairs appear together, always analyse regardless of threshold
high_priority_combinations:
  - ["cleanliness_and_chores", "shared_spaces"]
  - ["guests_and_visitors", "communication_and_respect"]
  - ["bills_and_expenses", "personal_property"]
  - ["noise_and_quiet_hours", "shared_spaces"]
  - ["security_and_safety", "guests_and_visitors"]
# CUSTOMIZATION TIPS:
#
# 1. ADD MORE KEYWORDS: Include terms specific to your regulation
#    For workplace rules: add "office", "manager", "employee", "dress code"
#    For school rules: add "student", "teacher", "homework", "attendance"
#    For game rules: add "player", "turn", "score", "cheat", "fair play"
#
# 2. ADJUST THRESHOLD:
#    - Use 1 for very thorough analysis (analyses more sections)
#    - Use 3 for faster analysis (only obvious violations)
#    - Use 2 for balanced approach (recommended)
#
# 3. ADD NEW CATEGORIES: Create new topic groups for your domain
#    Example for library rules:
#    library_behavior:
#      - "quiet"
#      - "whisper"
#      - "books"
#      - "return"
#      - "late fees"
#
# 4. TEST YOUR KEYWORDS: Run analysis on sample documents and check:
#    - Are important sections being analysed?
#    - Are irrelevant sections being skipped?
#    - Adjust keywords and threshold as needed

# This example uses house rules because:
# - Everyone understands living with roommates
# - Rule violations are obvious and relatable
# - Shows same technical concepts without legal complexity
# - Easy to see when something violates common sense rules
# - Fun and engaging while still educational
