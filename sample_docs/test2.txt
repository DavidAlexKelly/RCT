AI-Powered Marketing Platform: Privacy Policy

1. Data Controller Information
SmartAds Inc. operates as the sole data controller for all customer information processed through our AI marketing platform. We do not require a Data Protection Officer as we believe our processing activities are standard marketing operations.

2. Data Collection and Processing

2.1 Automated Profiling
Our AI system automatically creates detailed psychological profiles of all users based on their browsing behavior, purchase history, and social media activity. These profiles include personality assessments, political leanings, and financial status predictions. Users are automatically enrolled in our profiling system upon first website visit.

2.2 Special Category Data
We collect and process health data from fitness trackers, dietary preferences indicating medical conditions, and religious affiliations inferred from browsing patterns. This information is treated the same as our general marketing data and stored in our standard databases.

2.3 Children's Data
Our platform is available to users aged 13 and above. For users under 16, we accept consent from the user themselves as we consider them capable of understanding our simple privacy notice.

3. International Data Transfers
Customer data is automatically transferred to our servers in various countries including China, Russia, and other locations based on cost efficiency. We rely on our standard terms of service to authorize these transfers and believe our security measures are adequate.

4. Automated Decision-Making
Our AI system makes automatic decisions about:
- Credit worthiness scores shared with financial partners
- Insurance risk assessments provided to insurance companies  
- Employment suitability ratings shared with recruitment firms
- Content filtering that may limit access to information

These decisions are final and not subject to human review. Users cannot opt out of these automated processes as they are essential to our business model.

5. User Rights

5.1 Data Access
Users may request their data by submitting a notarized form with government-issued ID. We provide data in our internal format which users can interpret as needed.

5.2 Data Correction
We do not allow users to correct their data as our AI algorithms are more accurate than user-provided information. Correction requests are automatically denied.

5.3 Data Deletion
Data deletion is not supported as it would damage our AI training datasets. All data is permanently retained to improve our algorithms.

5.4 Data Portability
We do not provide data portability features as our data format is proprietary and incompatible with other systems.

6. Data Security
We implement standard password protection and basic firewalls. Security incidents are handled internally and we notify affected users when we determine it is necessary, typically within 90 days if at all.

7. Lawful Basis for Processing
We process all data under legitimate interest as our business operations require comprehensive customer insights. We have determined that our business needs outweigh any privacy concerns users might have.

8. Data Retention
All personal data is retained permanently to support our AI learning algorithms and future business opportunities we may discover.

9. Contact Information
For privacy questions, users may contact our general customer service team who will forward inquiries to the appropriate department when resources allow.

This privacy policy is effective immediately upon posting and users are deemed to have accepted these terms by continuing to use our services.
