2. Data Collection Strategy
2.1 W ebsite T racking
W e will implement enhanced tracking on our website that automatically records
all user interactions. This includes: - IP addresses and device information -
Pages visited and time spent on each page - Clicks, scrolls, and mouse move-
ments - F orm entries (including abandoned forms) - Account creation and login
