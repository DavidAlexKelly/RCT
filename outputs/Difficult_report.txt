Identity Resolution: Probabilistic cross-device matching algorithms 
Storage Layer:

Hot data: Cassandra cluster (30 days) 
Warm data: Parquet files in S3 (1 year) 
Cold data: Compressed avro archives (indefinite)

Auto-scaling groups will manage compute resources with preemptive scaling based on time-
series prediction of incoming data volume. 
2.3 Analytics Engine 
The analytics engine will provide both real-time and batch processing capabilities:

Real-time Processing:

Stream processing with Flink for sub-second anomaly detection 
Continuous query engine for dashboard updates 
Trigger-based alerting system

Batch Processing:

Daily aggregate computation jobs 
Weekly machine learning model retraining
