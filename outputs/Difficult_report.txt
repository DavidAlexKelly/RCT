DOCUMENT TEXT:
2. Technical Architecture 
2.1 Data Collection Layer 
The data collection layer will employ a distributed edge-capture system with the 
following components:

Client-side SDK: A lightweight JavaScript library (gzipped < 8KB) for web applications 
Mobile Integration Layer: Native SDKs for iOS and Android platforms 
IoT Data Connectors: REST API endpoints for smart device integration 
Legacy System Adapters: ETL pipelines for existing databases

Implementation will use WebSockets for real-time data streaming with a fallback to 
batched HTTP requests. The SDK will capture user interactions including:

Session metadata (device information, timestamps, location data) 
Event streams (clicks, views, transactions, form inputs) 
Application state changes 
Custom event triggers 
Profile data synchronization

A local buffer will maintain connectivity during intermittent network issues with 
exponential backoff retry logic. 
2.2 Data Processing Pipeline 
The processing architecture employs a scalable event-driven approach:

Ingestion Layer: Kafka streams with 3 partitions per topic 
Transformation Engine: Spark Streaming jobs with 5-minute micro-batching 
Enrichment Service: Real-time data enhancement using Redis for lookups 
Identity Resolution: Probabilistic cross-device matching algorithms 
Storage Layer:

Hot data: Cassandra cluster (30 days) 
Warm data: Parquet files in S3 (1 year) 
Cold data: Compressed avro archives (indefinite)

Auto-scaling groups will manage compute resources with preemptive scaling based on time-
series prediction of incoming data volume. 
2.3 Analytics Engine 
The analytics engine will provide both real-time and batch processing capabilities:

Real-time Processing:

Stream processing with Flink for sub-second anomaly detection 
Continuous query engine for dashboard updates 
Trigger-based alerting system

Batch Processing:

Daily aggregate computation jobs 
Weekly machine learning model retraining 
Monthly trend analysis and reports

Machine Learning Components:

Recommendation engine using collaborative filtering 
Churn prediction model with gradient boosting

[Page 2] User segmentation with k-means clustering 
Anomaly detection using isolation forests

The model serving layer will use TensorFlow Serving for ML models with A/B testing 
capabilities through feature flags.
