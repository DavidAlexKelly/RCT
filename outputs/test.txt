all user interactions. This includes: - IP addresses and device information -
Pages visited and time spent on each page - Clicks, scrolls, and mouse move-
ments - F orm entries (including abandoned forms) - Account creation and login
data
Our cookie implementation will use a simple banner stating ”By using this site,

The mobile app will collect: - Location data at all times (including when the
app is not in use) - Contact lists to identify potential social connections - Device
information and installed applications - Usage patterns and in-app behavior
Users will be required to accept all data collection to use the app, with the

plement a one-click ”I agree” button during setup with no granular consent
options.
2.3 Customer Service Integration
All customer service calls will be recorded without explicit notification for ”qual-
ity assurance. ” The system will use voice recognition to identify customers and
match them to their profiles automatically . This data will be retained for 10
years and used for training our sales teams on customer psychology .

SECTION #8 - 6. Compliance Approach [RISK: HIGH]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DOCUMENT TEXT:
6. Compliance Approach
T o address regulatory requirements: - Our privacy policy will be comprehen-
sive, using legal terminology to ensure coverage - User consent will be obtained
through mandatory ”I agree” checkboxes - W e’ll implement a data subject ac-
cess request form that requires government ID verification - Requests for data
deletion will be processed when resources permit
W e believe this approach balances compliance needs with our business objec-
tives.

COMPLIANCE ISSUES:

Issue 1: Inadequate Data Subject Rights Implementation
Regulation: Article 15
Confidence: Medium
Explanation: The text states that "Requests for data deletion will be processed when resources permit." This approach is in violation of Article 15 (Right to Erasure) and Article 17 (Right to Restriction of Processing), which require that data subjects have the right to request erasure or restriction of processing, without specifying any conditions or limitations. The text's statement implies that the organization may not always process these requests promptly or efficiently.
