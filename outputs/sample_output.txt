DOCUMENT TEXT:
3. Data Processing F ramework
1

[Page 2] 3.1 Unified Customer Database
The platform will create a single customer identity by linking all available data
points. This includes:
- Creating profiles for users even before they’ve created an account - Using
email addresses, phone numbers, and device IDs as linking keys - Purchasing
additional demographic data from third-party data brokers to enrich profiles -
Matching social media accounts where possible
3.2 Data Retention
T o maximize the value of our data assets: - All customer data will be stored
indefinitely - No automatic deletion or anonymization processes will be imple-
mented - Unsubscribed or inactive customers will remain in the database for
future reactivation campaigns - Customer deletion requests will be processed
within 90 days and may not include derived analytics
