--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DOCUMENT TEXT:
2. Data Collection Strategy
2.1 W ebsite T racking
W e will implement enhanced tracking on our website that automatically records
all user interactions. This includes: - IP addresses and device information -
Pages visited and time spent on each page - Clicks, scrolls, and mouse move-
ments - F orm entries (including abandoned forms) - Account creation and login
data
Our cookie implementation will use a simple banner stating ”By using this site,
you accept cookies” with no option to decline while maintaining full functionality .
Cookies will be stored for 5 years to ensure consistent user identification.
2.2 Mobile Application
The mobile app will collect: - Location data at all times (including when the
app is not in use) - Contact lists to identify potential social connections - Device
information and installed applications - Usage patterns and in-app behavior
Users will be required to accept all data collection to use the app, with the
privacy policy accessible through a small link in the settings menu. W e’ll im-
plement a one-click ”I agree” button during setup with no granular consent
options.
2.3 Customer Service Integration
All customer service calls will be recorded without explicit notification for ”qual-
ity assurance. ” The system will use voice recognition to identify customers and
match them to their profiles automatically . This data will be retained for 10
years and used for training our sales teams on customer psychology .

COMPLIANCE ISSUES:

Confidence: High
Explanation: The document presents a simple banner stating "By using this site, you accept cookies" with no option to decline while maintaining full functionality, which also violates GDPR's requirement that consent be freely given.
Citation: "By using this site, you accept cookies"
----------------------------------------

Issue 3: Special Category Processing
Regulation: 9(1)
Confidence: High
Explanation: The document mentions the use of voice recognition to identify customers and match them to their profiles without explicit notification for "quality assurance", which may violate GDPR's requirements for processing special categories of personal data.
Citation: "Voice recognition will be used to identify customers and match them to their profiles"
----------------------------------------

Issue 4: Excessive Retention Period
Regulation: 5(1)(e)
Confidence: High

[Page 2] 3.1 Unified Customer Database
The platform will create a single customer identity by linking all available data
points. This includes:
- Creating profiles for users even before they’ve created an account - Using
email addresses, phone numbers, and device IDs as linking keys - Purchasing
additional demographic data from third-party data brokers to enrich profiles -
Matching social media accounts where possible
3.2 Data Retention
T o maximize the value of our data assets: - All customer data will be stored
indefinitely - No automatic deletion or anonymization processes will be imple-
mented - Unsubscribed or inactive customers will remain in the database for
future reactivation campaigns - Customer deletion requests will be processed
within 90 days and may not include derived analytics

COMPLIANCE ISSUES:

Issue 1: Indefinite Data Storage
Regulation: 5(1)(e)
Confidence: High
Explanation: The document explicitly states that all customer data will be stored indefinitely, which violates GDPR's storage limitation principle.
Citation: "All customer data will be stored indefinitely"
----------------------------------------

Issue 2: Missing Data Subject Rights
Regulation: Article 17
Confidence: High
Explanation: The document implies that customers may not have the right to erasure (right to be forgotten) as per Article 17 of the GDPR, which grants data subjects the right to request erasure of their personal data.
Citation: "Customer deletion requests will be processed within 90 days and may not include derived analytics."

================================================================================

SECTION #6 - 4. Third-Party Data Sharing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DOCUMENT TEXT:
4. Third-Party Data Sharing
T o maximize revenue opportunities: - Anonymous customer segments will be
shared with our advertising partners - Aggregate data will be sold to industry
research firms - Select partners will receive access to our customer database
through our API - W e will implement data synchronization with social media
platforms to improve ad targeting

sive, using legal terminology to ensure coverage - User consent will be obtained
through mandatory ”I agree” checkboxes - W e’ll implement a data subject ac-
cess request form that requires government ID verification - Requests for data
deletion will be processed when resources permit
W e believe this approach balances compliance needs with our business objec-
tives.

COMPLIANCE ISSUES:

Issue 1: Inadequate Data Subject Rights Implementation
Regulation: Articles 15 and 17
