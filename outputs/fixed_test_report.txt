DOCUMENT TEXT:
2. Data Collection Strategy
2.1 W ebsite T racking
W e will implement enhanced tracking on our website that automatically records
all user interactions. This includes: - IP addresses and device information -
Pages visited and time spent on each page - Clicks, scrolls, and mouse move-
ments - F orm entries (including abandoned forms) - Account creation and login
data

The mobile app will collect: - Location data at all times (including when the
app is not in use) - Contact lists to identify potential social connections - Device
information and installed applications - Usage patterns and in-app behavior
Users will be required to accept all data collection to use the app, with the
privacy policy accessible through a small link in the settings menu. W e’ll im-
plement a one-click ”I agree” button during setup with no granular consent
options.
2.3 Customer Service Integration
All customer service calls will be recorded without explicit notification for ”qual-
ity assurance. ” The system will use voice recognition to identify customers and
match them to their profiles automatically . This data will be retained for 10

DOCUMENT TEXT:
6. Compliance Approach
T o address regulatory requirements: - Our privacy policy will be comprehen-
sive, using legal terminology to ensure coverage - User consent will be obtained
through mandatory ”I agree” checkboxes - W e’ll implement a data subject ac-
cess request form that requires government ID verification - Requests for data
deletion will be processed when resources permit
W e believe this approach balances compliance needs with our business objec-
tives.
