Regulation: Article 13
Confidence: Medium
Citation: "Privacy notices provided via standard legal documentation"
----------------------------------------

Point 2: supports compliance with Article 5(1)(a) - Lawfulness, fairness and transparency. RISK LEVEL: HIGH The document section analyzed appears to violate the GDPR principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency(a)) by stating that data will be preserved regardless of user preferences when legally defensible. This could lead to a lack of transparency in data processing and potential violations of users' rights. Additionally, the cost-effective security measures implemented by the AAP may not provide adequate protection for personal data, potentially violating Article 5(1)(f) - Integrity and confidentiality. On the positive side, the Transparency Approach provides privacy notices via standard legal documentation, which supports compliance with Article 13(2). The technical documentation maintained for regulatory demonstrations also supports compliance with Article 5(1)(a). However, without further analysis of the AAP's security measures and data processing practices, it is difficult to determine the overall risk level.
