Article 13(1):
  - Lack of transparency on data collection and processing violating Article 13(1). The document does not provide the identity and contact details of the controller, nor the purposes of the processing, which is required by Article 13(1). HIGH. (in 1. Project Goals, High confidence)

Article 13(2):
  - Lack of transparency and information: The document does not provide users with the period for which their personal data will be stored or the criteria used to determine that period, as required by Article 13(2) - Additional information to be provided.

Article 32:
  - Lack of data encryption at rest violating Article 32. RULES: HIGH confidence for clear violations, MEDIUM for likely issues, LOW for uncertain. (in 5. Security Considerations, High confidence)

Article 5(1)(e):
  - No granular consent options for data collection: The mobile app requires users to accept all data collection with no option to decline specific types of data collection or provide separate consent for each type of data collected. This violates the principle of transparency and user control over their personal data. HIGH confidence. RECOMMENDATION: To comply with GDPR, the organization should: * Provide clear information about the period for which cookies will be stored and the criteria used to determine that period. * Implement granular consent options for data collection in the mobile app, allowing users to choose which types of data they are comfortable sharing. * Obtain explicit user consent before recording customer service calls. * Review and revise the cookie implementation to ensure it complies with GDPR storage limitation requirements. (in 2. Data Collection Strategy (Part 1), High confidence)

[Page 2] 3.1 Unified Customer Database
The platform will create a single customer identity by linking all available data
points. This includes:
